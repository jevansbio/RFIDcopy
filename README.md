# RFIDcopy
Program to easily copy data from an SD card to an appropriate directory.

Written in Python. Currently windows only! Will create a Mac version if there is interest and I can persuade a Mac owning friend to let me compile apps on their machine.

Please e-mail me at jevansbio@gmail.com if you have any issues or suggestions.
